Getting Started
===============

Welcome to the documentation of laravel-audit.

This package provides simple endpoints that provide information and checks about the environment of the application.
Based on `Hexafuchs/laminas-security <https://github.com/Hexafuchs/laminas-security>`_ and the
`OWASP Cheat Sheet <https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/PHP_Configuration_Cheat_Sheet.html>`_.

Please feel free to debate existing checks and propose new ones. Security is a complex and evolving topic and many
people have better insight into this topic than us. Our focus was to create a framework that others can easily expand both
through the original code as well as through new packages that can register their own checks.
